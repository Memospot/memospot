# Memospot

[Memospot](https://github.com/lincolnthalles/memospot) is a self-contained desktop version of [Memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos), a beautiful, privacy-first, lightweight note-taking service.

This project is designed for people who:

- Are new to Docker
- Prefer not to host Memos themselves
- Wish to run Memos on their local machine with no Docker overhead
- Are interested in testing Memos before spinning up a Docker instance.

## Key features

- Easy to install and use
- Bundled Memos server build, based on official release tags
- Automated server startup and shutdown
- Internal Memos server listens only on localhost, at a random port

## Requirements

- Windows 10, macOS, or Linux
- System WebView (Edge, Safari, or WebkitGTK).
- Memos (bundled)

> On Windows, you will be prompted to install WebView2, if it's not available.

## Installation

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/lincolnthalles/memospot/releases).

> - On Windows, you may get a warning from Windows Defender SmartScreen. This is because the app is not signed.
> Just click `More info` and `Run anyway`.
>
> - Binaries are packed with UPX. This may trigger false positives on some antivirus software. You can unpack the binaries with `upx -d memos*`, if you will.
>
> - On macOS, you may need to [allow the app to run](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac) first.

## Manual server update

Download the latest server release from [memos-builds](https://github.com/lincolnthalles/memos-builds) and replace the `memos` binary in the installation folder.

### Windows Updater script

Open Powershell and run the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lincolnthalles/memospot/main/memos-server-updater.ps1'))
```

## Data Portability

If you plan to move your Memos instance to Docker in the future, keep the object storage setting at the default option `Database` for a drop-in migration. Just move `memos_prod.db` to the Docker volume and that's it.

Although, if you are storing huge files, it's a good idea to use `Local Storage` instead, even with this trade-off.

Data storage:

- Windows: data is stored under `%AppData%\memospot`
  
- POSIX systems: data is stored under `~/.memospot`
